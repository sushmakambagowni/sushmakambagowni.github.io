Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Marketing at Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh.

As a quantitative strategy researcher, I study how new technologies and digital platforms impact various aspects of marketing like innovation, branding, and consumer behavior. My dissertation research focuses on understanding drivers of user engagement and outcomes when interacting with immersive technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality. I employ advanced econometrics, text, image analytics and experiments to answer my research questions.
          
I am on the 2024-2025 marketing academic job market.
