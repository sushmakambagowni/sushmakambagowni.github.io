Iâ€™m a rising 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Marketing at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh.

As a quantitative strategy researcher, I study the impact of digital technologies and platform business models on innovation, branding, and consumer behavior. My dissertation research explores the nuances of platform dynamics and advertising engagement with immersive technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality. I employ advanced econometrics, text and image analytics and experiments to address my research questions.
          
I am on the 2024-2025 marketing academic job market.
