Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Marketing at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh.

As a quantitative marketing strategy researcher, I study the impact of digital technologies and platform business models on innovation, branding, and consumer behavior. My dissertation research explores the nuances of platform dynamics and advertising engagement with immersive technologies like Augmented and Virtual Reality. I employ advanced econometrics, text and image analytics and experiments to address my research questions.

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with distinction from Pondicherry University and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta. Prior to entering academia, I gained invaluable experience as a Business Strategy Consultant at Accenture Strategy, where I worked for three years.

I am on the 2024-2025 marketing academic job market.
